<div align="center">
  <p>I have created a car that is capable of moving autonomously and avoiding obstacles using an Arduino Uno board.</p>

  <p>I used two HC-SR04 distance sensors to measure the distance in front and behind the car.</p>
  <p>The car is powered by a 9V motor and steers using an SG90 servo motor. These are controlled by an L298N H-bridge.</p>

  <p>To signal obstacles and interact with the environment, two LEDs and a buzzer are used.</p>
